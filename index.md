## Research Interests

**<font color="#990000">I'm looking for self-motivated students, please send me an email with your CV!</font>**

My research focuses on computational imaging and visual intelligence, with an emphasis on hardware-software co-designed imaging and opto-electronic co-optimized computing. Current projects include novel computational imaging systems, AI-powered reconstruction methods, and optoelectronic computing architecture, aiming to advance both the sensing systems and algorithmic solutions.
