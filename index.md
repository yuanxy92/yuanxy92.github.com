## Research Interests

**<font color="#990000">I'm looking for self-motivated students, please send me an email with your CV!</font>**

My current research focuses on computational imaging and visual intelligence. More detailly, we focus on hardware-software co-designed imaging and opto-electronic co-optimized computing. Our projects relate to gigapixel Videography, large-scale Reconstruction, optoelectronic Computing, etc., towards both the intelligent sensing systems and algorithmic solutions.

- AI-powered computational imaging
- Optoelectronic computing
- Gigapixel videography
