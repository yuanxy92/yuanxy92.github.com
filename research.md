## [1. Computational imaging with camera arrays](/research/gigapixel/)
Camera array-based imaging uses a large number of inexpensive cameras to create virtual cameras that outperform real ones. 
They can function in many ways by changing the arrangement and aiming of the cameras. We developed an unstructured gigapixel array camera (UnstructuredCam), 
beyond the resolution of a single camera and human visual perception, which aims to capture the large-scale dynamic scene with both wide-FoV and high-resolution. 
The technology was successfully applied in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and, as one of its key innovations, received the 2021 Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Award for Technological Innovation ([2021年度北京市科学技术奖励技术发明一等奖](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/zhengce/zcjd/202212/t20221230_2887402.html)).

## [2. Photoacoustic tomography for human brain](/research/PACT/)
Functional photoacoustic computed tomography (fPACT) is instead label-free, and it allows for real-time imaging at high resolution. In photoacoustic imaging, light irradiated by pulsed lasers into tissue generates heat, which causes the local thermoelastic expansion of the tissue. This causes transient changes in pressure that can be detected by conventional ultrasonic transducers. fPACT can map neural activity in the brain by imaging oxygen saturation in blood (owing to the fact that activated neurons consume more oxygen, and that oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin have different absorption coefficients) and by discriminating venous blood from arterial blood. We report an implementation of fPACT that allows for the real-time functional imaging of the adult human brain at resolutions of 350 μm and 2 s.

## [3. Optical computing](/research/optical_computing/)
Light possesses the fastest propagation speed in physical space and offers multidimensional advantages (time, space, spectrum, etc.), making optical computing one of the ideal paradigms for building next-generation high-performance computing systems. Benefiting from the disruptive advantages of optical computing—high bandwidth, high parallelism, and low power consumption—optical computing theoretically promises to improve energy efficiency and computational speed compared to electronic computing. However, existing optical computing still faces challenges such as insufficient computational power, difficulties in dynamic computation, and low training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Monet (multi-channel optical neural networks) for advanced machine vision tasks, DANTE (DuAl-Neuron opTical-artificial lEarning) for large-scale optical neural network training, and a photonic neuromorphic architecture for lifelong learning.
